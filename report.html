    <h1 align="center">Gitcoin grants analysis report</h1>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
        This report aims to show some trends within Gitcoin grants' rounds 1-12.
    </p>
    <p>
        Let's begin with some global stats: <br/>
        <ul>
            <li>Total amount of funds raised: <u>$16,130,338.6</u></li>
            <li>Total amount of crowdfunds raised : <u>$9,357,245.1</u></li>
            <li>Total pool of match amounts: <u>$6,773,093.4</u></li>
            <li>Total grants: <u>2,134</u></li>
            <li>Total number of contributions: <u>1,350,623 </u></li>
            <li>Average amount of contribution per grant: <u>$11.9</u></li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <h3>Grants, new and old</h3>
    <p>As can bee seen in the following figure, the next round's % of new to total grants should hover around 20-30%. Rounds 9 trough 11 could be regarded as some sort of new grants' winter where the % of new grants has fallen sharply by almost 50%.

    <h3>Overall funds' distribution per rounds</h3>
    <p>
        Round 8 saw the biggest increase in crowdfunds, almost ~7x! then things started to slow down across the next three rounds. It was round 12 where grants enjoyed a good 2x increase in crowdfunds compared the the previous round.<br/> Round 12 is specially interesting in that every $1 of crowdfunds is matched with $1 in the matching pool on average.

    <h3>Contributions trend</h3>
    <p>
        Round 8 seems to be the bull market of gitcoin grants where total contributions spiked by ~4-5x followd by more than ~50% increase every next round! Expecting a 30% increase in total contributions in the next round(13) should not be ruled out.<br/>
        Another subtle point to pay attention to is how on average every unique contribution seems to result in ~ $15 of raised funds, at least what appears to be the case in the last 4 rounds. <i>Please note that this measure is a bit controversial and needs furthur research to clarify things.</i>

    <h3>Grants' demographics</h3>
    <p><b>undefined</b> refers to those grants whose founders have decided to not disclose their location.

    <h3>Tracking grants by their category</h3>
    <p><b>Community</b> and <b>dApp Tech</b> are close rivals here! Cautios here as some grants could be housed within both categories.

    <h3>Region-wise grants per each round</h3>
    <p>As Gitcoin ages, it seems that more people are introduced to it. Here we can see that all regions are showing organic growth.        
    </p>

    <h3>Category-wise grants per round</h3>
    <p>This is an interesting chart! People have given up building Gitcoin, either tracks have been updated(=> dGov) or there are not much to build on Gitcoin anymore?! DAOs seem to be gaining momentum starting with round 9 and NFTs show rise and fall similar to the market cap fluctuations. Oh, why Crypto for Black Lives died btw? </p>

    <h3>Starved grants</h3>
    <p>Assuming it takes $5 worth of energy to create a grant on Gitcoin, the following figure demonstrates what % of grants failed raise a minimum of $5 :)<br/>
    Rounds 2 and 3 had the most lucky grants, almost all received some pie from the cake while round 12 saw the biggest massacre in raised funds. Round 8 is interesting in that both the total raised funds is high(~2.5m) and also less than 5% of the grants were deprived of $.</p>
